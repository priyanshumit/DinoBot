# DinoBot

Google_Chrome_Dino_Bot

Let's Automate the Google's Dino Game using python and Image_Processsing.

# Libraries Used
1. Opencv - pip install opencv-python
2. Numpy - pip install numpy
3. Pyautogui - pip install pyautogui
4. mss - pip install mss

We will be using mss to grab screenshot at regular intervals. Then using opencv to know if there is a cactus coming toward us we will press the up button on the keyboard using pyautogui so that our bot skips the cactus.
